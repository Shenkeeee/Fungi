      <h1>Role in the ecosystem</h1>
      <p>Fungi play a critical role in the ecosystem as decomposers, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the soil. They also form symbiotic relationships with many plants, aiding in nutrient uptake and contributing to plant growth and overall ecosystem health.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Fungi play a crucial role in breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutualistic Relationships:</strong> Fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), bacteria (rhizobia), and algae (lichens), exchanging nutrients and providing important benefits to their partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Pathogens:</strong> Some fungi are pathogens and cause diseases in plants and animals, including humans.</li>
      <li><strong>Food Sources:</strong> Fungi are a source of food for many animals, including insects, small mammals, and birds.</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Formation and Fertility:</strong> Fungi play a role in soil formation and fertility by breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients, improving soil structure and water retention.</li>
      <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Fungi are important components of biodiversity and contribute to the functioning and stability of ecosystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Bioremediation:</strong> Certain fungi can break down pollutants and remediate contaminated environments.</li>
